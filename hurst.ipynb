      "A <font color=\"blue\">stationary process</font> is a stochastic process whose joint probabilty distribution does not change when shifted in time. Formally, let $(X_{t})$ be a sochastic process and let $F_{X}(x_{t_{1}+\\tau}, \\ldots, x_{t_{k} + \\tau})$ denote the cumulative distribution function of the joint distribution at times $t_{1}+\\tau$, $\\ldots$, $t_{k}+\\tau$.

In the discrete setting, we can take a random vector such that its components have probability distribution with mean $0$ and finite variance, and are independent (so their joint distribution must be the product of the individual distributions). \n",
